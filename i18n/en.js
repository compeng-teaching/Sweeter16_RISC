## Introduction
The SWEETER16 Processor Simulator is a tool designed to help users understand and simulate the functionality of a 16-bit processor. It allows you to input assembly code, execute instructions step-by-step, and view the internal state of registers, flags, and memory in real time.

## Key Features
1. Input Assembly Code: Paste your assembly code into the provided text area.
2. Instruction Execution: Execute instructions one at a time or load predefined sample programs.
3. Memory Management: Update memory dynamically with hexadecimal values.
4. Real-Time Visualization: Monitor changes in registers, flags, and memory dynamically.
5. Instruction Set Support: Supports arithmetic, logic, control flow, and memory instructions.

## Quick Start
1. Loading a Program:
   - Paste your assembly code into the "Original Code" textarea.
   - Click on the "Convert" button to parse the code.

2. Executing Instructions:
   - Use the "Run Next" button to execute one instruction at a time.
   - The results are reflected in registers, flags, and memory in real time.

3. Updating Memory:
   - Enter a memory address and content in the format "ADDRESS:CONTENT" (e.g., "0008:0010") in the input field.
   - Click the "Add" button to update the memory.

4. Viewing Registers and Flags:
   - The current values of all registers (R0 to R7) are displayed dynamically.
   - Flags (CF, ZF, OF, NF) update after each instruction that modifies them.

## Tabs and Content
1. Sample Programs: Click the tab to view example assembly programs.
2. Instruction Set: Tab for supported instructions, syntax, and examples.
3. User Manual: This guide.`
